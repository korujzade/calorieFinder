# calorieFinder
Recently, I have find out my first ever web application, created a few years ago. This is actually very basic web page to look for calorie of any food, which made using ajax+php for back-end and bootstrap framework for front-end. You can check it out <a href="http://finder.orujzade.com" target="_blank"> here</a>.

P.S. I have parsed <a href="http://calorielab.com"> calorielab </a> main webpage to get information about foods. I hope they will not get angry about it, as I haven't being used it for commercial purposes :)
